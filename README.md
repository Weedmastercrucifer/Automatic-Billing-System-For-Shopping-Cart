# Automatic-Billing-System-For-Shopping-Cart
In this project, we provide three inputs corresponding to three different items that need to be billed for a shopping cart. The items can be added any number of times by the user. When the user presses Pay, the amount is paid, and the cost is reset to zero. A reset function is provided, which resets the cost to zero for a new transaction cycle. 
The project is implemented on the FPGA Zedboard Zynq Evaluation and Development Kit.
